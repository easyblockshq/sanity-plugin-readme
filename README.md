## About the Shopstory

Shopstory is the first visual/no-code builder that works inside of Sanity. Itâ€™s like Squarespace but compatible with your data model, front-end and design tokens. With Shopstory designers, marketers and content teams can build new visual content without waiting for developers.

-   Build entire landing / campaign pages visually
-   Build single content sections visually and add them to existing repeater fields
-   Extend product or collection pages with extra content sections.
-   Inject small content pieces within product collection grids
-   Embed visually-built content within menus, search results, popups, cart, etc.

Visit our [documentation](https://docs.shopstory.app/) to find out more.

### How it works?

-   Shopstory is simply a new CMS field. Developers can add Shopstory field anywhere within existing data model.
-   Fetch Shopstory content via Sanity API and render in any part of your React front-end. We provide easy-to-use SDK to orchestrate everything.
